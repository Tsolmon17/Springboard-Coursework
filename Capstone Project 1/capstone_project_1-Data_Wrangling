1.	I renamed my file so that it doesn’t have spaces
2.	Saved as CSV file
3.	Imported packages: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

4.	Imported my data with two header rows and set first column as my index column

data = 'default_of_credit_card_clients.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data, index_col=0, header=[0,1])

5.	Visual inspection: 

df.head()
df.tail()
df.columns
df.shape
df.describe

Note: data set looks pretty clean and there seems to no values missing;
all data types are int64;
there are categorical variables and ordinal variables that needs to have appropriate data types;
 also, there two header rows with first being X numbered and second row with column names

6.	Dropping one of the header rows

df.columns = df.columns.droplevel(0)

7.	Further inspection of columns with .value_counts() to spot any outliers or errors

8.	‘EDUCATION’ column supposed to have values from 1 thru 4 (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 4 = others) but have values from 0 thru 6. This represents a very very small fraction of the overall data (345 of 30,000) so I decided to replace them with 4 = others category. 

df.EDUCATION.value_counts()

2    14030
1    10585
3     4917
5      280
4      123
6       51
0       14
Name: EDUCATION, dtype: int64

9.	Column ‘MARRIAGE’ supposed to have numbers from 1 thru 3 for Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = others). It’s showing extra variable 0 for 54 rows which is insignificant. I will change 0 variables 3 = others. 

10.	Changing data types of columns with categorical values (gender, education, marriage status)
11.	After further exploring columns 6-11 which correspond to payment status: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above. I found there undefined variables 0 and -2.
